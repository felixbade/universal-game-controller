Simple game input for ðŸ’»Â keyboard, ðŸ“±Â touchscreen and ðŸŽ®Â gamepad through a unified API. Made for game jams.

### Why?
- Youâ€™ll need keyboard support for maximum game development speed and compatibility.
- However, actual gameplay will be more fun and impressive with a game controller. Only if you had the time...
- Touchscreen support will make it 100x easier to show the game to your friends after the game jam.

### How?

Current game inputs are:
- one joystick
- one button

Constraining? Thatâ€™s where creativity starts! Never underestimate the power of simplicity â€“ easy to learn is easy to love.

See importing instructions below.

## Design goals
- Fun and practical to use in game jams.
- Games are equally playable on laptop (for development), TV (for immersion) and phone (for sharing).
- Easy to use for new players (on all platforms).
- Fun even at high skill levels (on all platforms).
- Light-weight and zero dependencies.

## Features

All user inputs are provided as a state of the controller â€“ no events as of now. These are meant to be read in the game update loop.

### Joystick
`controller.move`: `{ x, y }`
- Output is a 2D vector that is guaranteed to be inside the unit circle (even if multiple controllers are used at once).
- Gamepad: Analog left joystick (with a dead zone for drift compensation).
- Keyboard: WASD (with diagonal length compensation).
- Touchscreen: The first touch (anywhere) can be slided around as a virtual joystick. Scrolling the page is disabled (also on Safari).
- Should be exactly (0, 0) when the user is not touching the controls â€“Â however, this is not guaranteed for gamepad, since the neutral position might vary from device to device, and there is no specification for maximum allowed drift.

### Trigger button
`controller.trigger`: boolean
- Gamepad: Button 1 (Xbox: A, Switch: B)
- Keyboard: Space. Scrolling is prevented.
- Touchscreen: Second touch (anywhere). The button is sustained even if the first touch ends.

### Controller type
`controller.type`: `InputType`
- The game can display instructions for the specific input device that the player is using.
- If a gamepad is connected, type is always gamepad.
- Otherwise touchscreen and keyboard will switch to the one that had the last input event.
- On page load before any user actions, type is touchscreen [if a touchscreen is present](https://hacks.mozilla.org/2013/04/detecting-touch-its-the-why-not-the-how/).

## Example using URL import
```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
    <head>
        <script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/universal-game-controller@1.3.0/dist/main.js"></script>
    </head>
    <body>
        <div id="output" style="border: solid 2vw hsl(210, 50%, 12%); width: 20vw; height: 20vw; border-radius: 50%; position: absolute; left: calc(50% - 10vw); top: calc(50% - 10vw);"></div>
        <script>
            const controller = UniversalGameController.controller;

            const output = document.querySelector('#output');

            setInterval(() => {
                const move = controller.move;
                output.style.transform = `translate(${move.x * 20}vw, ${move.y * 20}vw)`;

                if (controller.trigger) {
                    output.style.backgroundColor = 'white';
                } else {
                    output.style.backgroundColor = 'hsl(210, 50%, 12%)';
                }
            }, 10);

## Ideas
- Configurations for gamepad joystick dead zone and touchscreen virtual joystick size.
- Provide the current touch coordinates for displaying virtual joysticks.
- Capturing touch input only on specific DOM elements.
- Twin-stick.
- Events for trigger button state change.
- Mouse support (because WASD has only 8 directions and this can be too limiting in top-down shooting games).
- Optional joystick smoothing (to make it easier to move only a tiny bit with WASD).
- More buttons with game-defined graphics for touchscreen version (how to hide them when touch screen is not present?)

## Non-goals
- Anything that displays graphics (e.g. virtual joysticks).
- Anything that requires user action to enable (e.g. motion sensor).
- Local multiplayer. Well, maybe. Multiplayer is fun, but this gets a bit complicated to handle in a generic way. The main point of this library is to provide an opinionated mapping between different input types, and there more trade-offs with 2-player control mapping possibilities.
- Exposing all features of each input method. If you need more, just use the vanilla APIs â€“ they are not *that* complicated.
- XR / 3D input.
